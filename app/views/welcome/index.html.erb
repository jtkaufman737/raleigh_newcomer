        <p>I've been fortunate enough to see some beautiful cities - Munich, London, Paris -- I've also lived all around the
        beautiful DC area. (Baltimore City, 5 minutes outside of Crystal City, Northern VA, Manassas.) When I hit 26, I finally
        decided to find a nice quiet place to settle down. I essentially picked Raleigh off a map, and I've loved it ever since.
        Since this is a smaller city than I'm used to, I am making this app to catalog the good places I've found down here.
        (Especially since there are certain things - like good sushi - that are like LochNess level hard to find :/)</p>
